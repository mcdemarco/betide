# Betide

Betide is a small client-side JavaScript app that uses the COLOURlovers.com API to randomly display the most popular seamless patterns generated by COLOURlovers users, or, optionally, the most recent patterns rather than the most loved.

## Use

Open the page.  There's a [demo here](http://mcdemarco.github.io/betide/).

Each pattern's title and lover (author) are shown at the top of the window on hover (or after you touch on a touch screen).  The title link opens the pattern on the COLOURlovers website (in a new tab or window).  The lover link restricts Betide to that lover's patterns only.

Betide will not run when offline.

## Credits

Betide uses the [COLOURlovers.com API](http://www.colourlovers.com/api); please see that page for licensing details for reuse.  
The JavaScript is based on [my fork](https://github.com/mcdemarco/color-tide) of [color-tide](https://github.com/ryan-ludwig/color-tide), the app that showed me you can access the COLOURlovers API with ajax, even though the website doesn't mention it.  
The CSS animations are based on [Mark Lee's crossfading CSS slideshow](http://themarklee.com/2013/10/16/simple-crossfading-slideshow-css/).
